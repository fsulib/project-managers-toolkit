# FSU-project-managers-toolkit
This document is based off of the crowdsourced [project managers toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCZaScfh1VsvkOH4ksZDh6exzAH7n8_mMrpnw4yINcI/edit), written by members of the CLIR-DLF Project Management Special Interest Group.

The document has been forked from the CLIR-DLF project manager's toolkit GitHub, and has been adapted to reflect the project management practices at Florida State University Libraries.
